In 1849, he returned to his successful law practice in [[Springfield, Illinois]]. In 1854, he was angered by the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], which opened the territories to slavery, causing him to re-enter politics. He soon became a leader of the new [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates|1858 Senate campaign debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas|Stephen A. Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for president [[1860 United States presidential election|in 1860]], sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] to gain victory. Pro-slavery elements in the [[Southern United States|South]] viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and Southern states began [[Secession in the United States|seceding from the nation]]. During this time, the newly formed [[Confederate States of America]] began seizing federal military bases in the South. A little over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, Confederate forces [[Battle of Fort Sumter|attacked Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in South Carolina.

His allies, the [[War Democrat]]s and the [[Radical Republicans]], demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates. He managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. Anti-war Democrats (called \"[[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]\") despised Lincoln, and some irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements went so far as to plot his assassination. His [[Gettysburg Address]] came to be seen as one of the greatest and most influential statements of American national purpose. Lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals, and implemented a [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'' in [[Ex parte Merryman|Maryland]] and [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)|elsewhere]], and averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. In 1863, he issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which declared the slaves in the states \"in rebellion\" to be free. It also directed the Army and Navy to \"recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons\", and to receive them \"into the armed service of the United States.\" Lincoln pressured [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and he promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]], which abolished slavery, except as punishment for a crime.\n",

Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a [[white supremacist]] in 1968.{{sfn|Bennett|1968|pp=35–42}} He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. Bennett argued that Lincoln opposed social equality and proposed that freed slaves voluntarily move to another country. The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government to emancipate them.{{sfnm|1a1=Cashin|1y=2002|1p=61|2a1=Kelley|2a2=Lewis|2y=2005|2p=228}} Defenders of Lincoln, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day{{sfn|Dirck|2008|p=31}} and that he was a \"moral visionary\" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible.{{sfn|Striner|2006|pp=2–4}} Dirck stated that few Civil War scholars take Bennett seriously, pointing to his \"narrow political agenda and faulty research\".{{sfn|Dirck|2009|p=382}}\n",

                        "'''Anarchism''' is a political philosophy and Political movement that is skeptical of all justifications for authority and seeks to abolish the institutions it claims maintain unnecessary coercion and Social hierarchy, typically including Nation state, and capitalism. Anarchism advocates for the replacement of the state with Stateless society and Voluntary association Free association (communism and anarchism). As a historically left-wing movement, this reading of anarchism is placed on the Far-left politics of the political spectrum, usually described as the libertarian wing of the socialist movement (libertarian socialism).\n",
                        "Humans have lived in society without formal hierarchies long before the establishment of states, realms, or empires. With the rise of organised hierarchical bodies, scepticism toward authority also rose. Although traces of anarchist ideas are found all throughout history, modern anarchism emerged from the Age of Enlightenment. During the latter half of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century, the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers' struggles for emancipation. Anarchist schools of thought formed during this period. Anarchists have taken part in several revolutions, most notably in the Paris Commune, the Russian Civil War and the Spanish Civil War, whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism. In the last decades of the 20th and into the 21st century, the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more, growing in popularity and influence within anti-capitalist, anti-war and anti-globalisation movements.\n",
                        "Anarchists employ diversity of tactics, which may be generally divided into revolutionary and evolutionary strategies; there is significant overlap between the two. Evolutionary methods try to simulate what an anarchist society might be like, but revolutionary tactics, which have historically taken a violent turn, aim to overthrow authority and the state. Many facets of human civilization have been influenced by anarchist theory, critique, and Praxis (process).\n",
