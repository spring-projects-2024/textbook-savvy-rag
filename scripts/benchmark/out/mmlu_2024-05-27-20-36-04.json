      "We can solve this problem by using the formula for the sum of two fractions. The sum of two fractions is equal to the sum of their numerators divided by their denominators. In this case, the sum of the numerators is $x + y$ and the sum of the denominators is $14 + 6 = 20$. So, the sum of the two fractions is $x + y = \\frac{x + y}{20}$. We can solve for $x$ and $y$ by dividing both sides by $20$ and adding the two fractions together. The ordered pair $(x,y)$ is $\\left(\\frac{x + y}{20}, \\frac{x + y}{20}\\right)$.\nTherefore, the answer is (B).",
