To find the value of $21^2 + 22^2 + \\cdots + 40^2$, we can use the quadratic formula: $21^2 + 22^2 + \\cdots + 40^2 = (n(n+1)(2n+1)) \\cdot (n+1) \\cdot (2n+1)$, where $n$ is the number of terms in the quadratic equation. We can use the fact that the coefficient of the $n+1$th term is $2n+1$, which is the same as the coefficient of the $n$th term in the quadratic formula. Therefore, we can substitute $n = 40$ in the quadratic formula and solve for $n$ to find the value of $21^2 + 22^2 + \\cdots + 40^2$. The answer is $2870$.",
