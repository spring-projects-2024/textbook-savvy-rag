The sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula:\n$$ S_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} $$\nwhere $S_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, and $n$ is the number of terms in the series. In this case, the first term is $1$, the second term is $2$, and the third term is $3$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n$$ S_n = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 3n^2 $$\nNow, we can substitute the value of $n$ into the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:\n$$ S_{21} = 3(21^2) = 633 $$\nTherefore, the value of $21^2 + 22^2 + \\cdots + 40^2$ is $633$.
