      "The degree of a field extension is given by the formula: d = \ufffd\ufffd(x^2 - 4xy + 4y^2) / (x - 2y). The given field extension is Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)). Plugging in the values, we get d = \ufffd\ufffd(sqrt(2)^2 - 4sqrt(2)(sqrt(3))^2 + 4sqrt(3)^2 / (sqrt(2) - 2sqrt(3)). Simplifying, we get d = \ufffd\ufffd(4 - 12 + 18) / (sqrt(2) - 2sqrt(3)). Simplifying further, we get d = \ufffd\ufffd(10 - 12) / (sqrt(2) - 2sqrt(3)). Simplifying further, we get d = \ufffd\ufffd(-2) / (sqrt(2) - 2sqrt(3)).
